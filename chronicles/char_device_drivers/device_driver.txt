Device Driver:
==============
1. A Device Driver is a piece of code that configures and manages a Device.
2. It knows how to configure the Device, sending data to the Device and how to process the requests that originate from the Device.
3. When the Device Driver is loaded into the OS, it exposes the interface to the User-space to enable the User application's communication with the Device.

How Device Driver Functions:
****************************
1. Device drivers operate inside the OS Kernel-space.
2. They work in a highly privileged environment because they need low-level access to HW operations to function.
3. They receive requests from the OS to access and execute Device instructions.
4. After completing the requests, they transmit the Deviceâ€™s outputs or messages to the OS.
5. The complete visual representation of the Device Driver function is as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User-space: User-level Programs ---> read, write, open, echo ...
                                      |      |     |     |
                                      |      |     |     |		User-level Programs use System-calls to talk to the Device.
                                      |      |     |     |
                                      V      V     V     V
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
User-space: Device file interface --->	   /dev/DEVICE
						^			Device Driver provides an interface to the User-space.
						^			It is used by the User-level Programs for communication.
						|			In Linux, the Device is accessed using the File technique.
						|
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kernel-space: The Kernel connects the generated System-calls to the Device Driver's System-call Handler Methods.
						|
						V
				--------------------------------	Device Driver takes the burden of:
				    Device Driver for DEVICE		---> Configuring the various registers of the Device.
				--------------------------------	---> Exporting the interface to the User-space.
						^			---> Interacting with the Device.
						^			---> Processing the requests from the Device.

Properties:
***********
1. A Device Driver is a specialized software that operates a particular Device, offering a SW interface to the HW.
2. It allows Operating System and other applications to access the Device functionalities.
3. The Device is linked to a Bus/Communication sub-system via which Device Drivers interact with the Device.
4. They are Handler-dependent and OS-specific.
5. They offer the Interrupt processing that is essential for any time-dependent Asynchronous HW interface.
6. They define the messages and mechanisms through which the OS and applications can access the Device or make requests to the Device.
7. They handle the Device responses and messages for delivery to the OS.
