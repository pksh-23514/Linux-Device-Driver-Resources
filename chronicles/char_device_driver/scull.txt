Simple Character Utility for Loading Localities (scull):
========================================================

2. For ease of usage, the word Device can be used interchangeably for the Memory area used by scull.
3. The advantage of scull is that it is HW independent. The reason being that the scull acts on Memory allocated from the Kernel.
4. The scull is portable across all the Architectures on which the Linux runs.
5. It is easy for scull to demonstrate the interface between the Kernel and Char Drivers and execute some tests.
