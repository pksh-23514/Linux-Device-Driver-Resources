Device Registration in the scull:
=================================

scull Structure:
****************
1. Internally, the scull represents each Device with a Structure Data-type 'struct scull_dev'.
	=> struct scull_dev {
		   struct scull_qset *data;	/* The Pointer to the first quantum set */
		   int quantum;			/* The current quantum size */
		   int qset;			/* The current array size */
		   unsigned long size;		/* The amount of data stored here */
		   struct semaphore sem;	/* The mutual exclusion Semaphore */
		   struct cdev cdev;		/* The Char Device Structure */
	   };
