Device Registration in the scull:
=================================

scull Structure:
****************
1. Internally, the scull represents each Device with a Structure Data-type 'struct scull_dev'.
	=> struct scull_dev {
		   struct scull_qset *data;	/* The Pointer to the first quantum set */
		   int quantum;			/* The current quantum size */
		   int qset;			/* The current array size */
		   unsigned long size;		/* The amount of data stored here */
		   struct semaphore sem;	/* The mutual exclusion Semaphore */
		   struct cdev cdev;		/* The Char Device Structure */
	   };

Char Device Registration Implementation:
****************************************
1. The 'cdev' Structure is embedded within the 'scull_dev' Structure.
2. Therefore to initialize the 'cdev' Structure using the 'cdev_init' function, the 'scull_dev' Structure field shall be used.
	=> cdev_init(&dev->cdev, &scull_fops);
3. To register the 'cdev' Structure with the Kernel using the 'cdev_add' function, the same 'scull_dev' Structure field shall be used.
	=> err = cdev_add(&dev->cdev, dev, 1);
