Device Number:
==============
1. The Kernel connects the System-calls to the specific operation implementation of the intended Driver.
2. This connection is established by the Kernel by using the Device number for the Driver.
3. Char Devices are accessed through names (also called Device files) in the file-system located in the "/dev" directory.
4. The Device number for a particular Device are a pair of two numbers: Major and Minor number.
5. The same Driver is capable of handling multiple Devices, therefore there is a pair of Device number to identify the intended Device.
	=> The Major number identifies the Driver associated with the Device.
	=> The Minor number identifies the Device instance (exact HW Device).
6. The Syntax for the Device number is as visible for the Device is:
	---> Major number , Minor number
7. The System-calls are made to the particular Device file (/dev/DEVICE) and are handled by the VFS in the Kernel-space.
8. The VFS compares the Device number with the Driver registration table in the Kernel and picks the correct Driver.
9. Based on the Driver selected by the VFS, the Kernel connects the System-calls to the specific operation implementation in the Driver.
