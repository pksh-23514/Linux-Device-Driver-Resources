Memory Usage in the scull:
==========================

Device in scull:
****************
1. Before implementing the 'read' and 'write' functions for the scull, it is important to understand how the scull performs Memory allocation.
2. This Memory allocation technique is limited to scull only. Also, it is very different from the actual HW management in the real Device Drivers.
3. The region of Memory used by scull is called as Device. It is variable in length.
4. The more data is written to the Device, it is grown bigger. Similarly, the trimming is performed by over-writing this Device with a shorter file.
