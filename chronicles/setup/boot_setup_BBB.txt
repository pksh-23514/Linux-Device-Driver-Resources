Boot Sequence for BeagleBone Black:
===================================
1. The Boot switch (S2) on the board decides the Boot sequence during Power-up.
2. There are a certain number of ways through which the board can be booted-up.
3. If the Boot button is not pressed, the sequence of methods through which the board can be booted is:
	=> MMC1 (eMMC) ---> MMC0 (SD card) ---> UART0 ---> USB0
4. If the Boot button is pressed, the sequence of methods through which the board can be booted is:
	=> SPI0 ---> MMC0 (SD card) ---> USB0 ---> UART0
5. Wherever, the valid Boot partitions and relevant files are available; the Booting happens from that souce. Otherwise, the next source in the sequence is checked.
6. The board is pre-installed with the Debian OS present in the eMMC.
7. To boot the board from the SD card, the Boot button has to be pressed so that the first source containing the valid Boot partitions is the SD card.
8. The Boot button affects the register SYSBOOT[4:0]. The Reset button doesn't have any affect on this register.

Preparing SD card for Booting:
==============================
1. Connect the SD card to the Host using a Card reader.
2. Using the GParted application, create 2 partitions on the SD card: FAT16 and EXT4.
3. Launch the GParted application and authenticate using the PC password.
4. Select the correct Device (/dev/sdx) by checking the Device details from "/dev".
5. The SD card initially could already have a particular file system formatting such as FAT32.
6. Right click on the device and 'Delete' all the partitions so that the complete storage is available for allocation.
7. After deleting the existing partitions, the device partiton displays as "unallocated".
8. Right click again and select 'New' to create a new partition on the SD card. Select the following options and click 'Add':
	1) Create as: Primary Partition
	2) File system: fat16
	3) New size (MiB): 256
	4) Label: BOOT
9. Right click again and select 'New' to create a new partition on the SD card. Select the following options and click 'Add':
	1) Create as: Primary Partition
	2) File system: ext4
	3) New size (MiB): Whatever the remaining size is left
	4) Label: ROOTFS
10. Click on the 'Apply All Operations' (green arrow) option and select 'Apply' on the dialogue box.
11. The operation will take sometime to delete and add the partitions.
12. There are some flags to be managed for the BOOT partition to make it bootable. Right click on the partition and select the following options from 'Manage Flags':
	1) boot
	2) lba
13. After this selection, the partition will have these flags displayed along with the other details.
14. Close the GParted application.
15. Now, 2 partitions are visible to be mounted. If these are not visible, remove and re-insert the SD card.

Copying the Boot Images and Root FS to SD card:
===============================================
1. Run the "lsblk" command to check the Mount location for the BOOT and the ROOTFS partitions.
2. The Boot Images downloaded contain the following:
	1) Device Tree Binary (dtb)
	2) Primary Boot Loader (MLO)
	3) U-Boot Bootloader Image (u-boot.img)
	4) U-Boot commands and Environment settings (uEnv.txt)
	5) Kernel Image (uImage)
3. Copy the Boot Image (unzipped form) files to the mounted location of the BOOT partition and run the "sync" command.
4. Unzip the Root FS (.xz zipped form). The Root FS is now available in the Image format (.img). However, this Image has to be mounted first.
5. Right click on the Image file and select 'Open with Disk Image Mounter'. Using "lsblk" command, the mounted location of the Root FS can be checked.
6. Go to the Root FS mount location and copy the Root FS files to the mounted location of the ROOTFS partition. This migt require 'sudo' access to copy.
7. Run the "sync" command. 'Sync' means synchronize cached writes to persistent storage. It deflushes the in between cache data to the physical media.
8. In the BOOT and ROOTFS partitions, the copied files are displayed. Unmount the SD card from the Host.
