Linux Kernel Image Compilation:
===============================
1. Clone the latest stable Kernel Image from the BBB official GitHub link: https://github.com/beagleboard/linux
2. After the cloning is completed, the steps are executed from inside the cloned directory (/workdir/linux_source_BBB_ver).
3. The temporary folder, object files, images generated and .config file generated previously has to be deleted:
	=> make ARCH=arm distclean
4. The .config file has to be generated based on the default file (/workdir/linux_source_BBB_ver/arch/arm/configs/bb.org_defconfig) provided by the Vendor:
	=> make ARCH=arm bb.org_defconfig
5. The change in Kernel configurations can be done through the 'menuconfig' tool:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig
6. The  Kernel Image "uImage", Device Tree Binaries "dtb" etc are generated:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j4
7. The Kernel Modules (.ko) are generated:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules -j4
8. The generated Kernel Modules are installed on the default path of the Host (/lib/modules/linux_source_BBB_ver):
	=> sudo make ARCH=arm modules_install

Kernel Image Update on SD card:
===============================
1. Connect the SD card to the Host using a Card reader.
2. In the BOOT partition, rename the the existing "uImage" and ".dtb" files as a backup.
3. From the cloned directory, navigate to the path containing the "uImage" file (/workdir/linux_source_BBB_ver/arch/arm/boot).
4. Copy the "uImage" file from this path to the BOOT partition:
	=> cp uImage /<SD_card_Mount_Path>/BOOT/
5. From the cloned directory, navigate to the path containing the ".dtb" file (/workdir/linux_source_BBB_ver/arch/arm/boot/dts).
6. Copy the ".dtb" file from this path to the BOOT partition:
	=> cp am335x-boneblack.dtb /<SD_card_Mount_Path>/BOOT/
7. The BOOT partition will now contain both the updated and the backed-up "uImage" and ".dtb" files.
8. On the Host, navigate to the path containing the Kernel Modules (/lib/modules/linux_source_BBB_ver).
9. Copy the Kernel Modules from this path to the path (/lib/modules) on the ROOTFS partition:
	=> sudo cp -a <linux_source_BBB_ver>/ /<SD_card_Mount_Path>/ROOTFS/lib/modules/
10. Synchronize the changes to ensure the data is written to the SD card properly:
	=> sync
