Linux Kernel Image Update:
==========================
1. Clone the latest stable Kernel Image from the BBB official GitHub link: https://github.com/beagleboard/linux
2. After the cloning is completed, the steps are executed from inside the cloned directory.
3. The temporary folder, object files, images generated and .config file generated previously has to be deleted:
	=> make ARCH=arm distclean
4. The .config file has to be generated based on the default file (arch/arm/configs/bb.org_defconfig) provided by the Vendor:
	=> make ARCH=arm bb.org_defconfig
5. The change in Kernel configurations can be done through the 'menuconfig' tool:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- menuconfig
6. The  Kernel Image "uImage", Device Tree Binaries "dtb" etc are generated:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- uImage dtbs LOADADDR=0x80008000 -j4
7. The Kernel Modules (.ko) are generated:
	=> make ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- modules -j4
8. The generated Kernel Modules are installed on the default path of the Host (/lib/modules/<kernel_ver>):
	=> sudo make ARCH=arm modules_install
