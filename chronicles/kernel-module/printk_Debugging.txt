Debugging with printk:
======================
1. 'printf' is one of the best debugging tool used in User-level applications.
2. In the Kernel-space, there is no access to the User-level functions like 'printf'.
3. The Kernel has it's own API 'printk' for Kernel-space printing.
4. The Syntax is:
	---> printk(KERN_INFO "Message: %s\n", arg);
5. The 'printk' messages are printed to the Kernel log buffer, which is a ring buffer exported to User-space through /dev/kmsg.
6. The 'dmesg' command is used to read the Kernel messages.
7. The 'printk' format String is mostly compatible with C99. However, it does not support Floating-point formats (%e, %f and %g).
8. The 'printk' message can specify a Log-level specified by the 'KERN_INFO' value.
