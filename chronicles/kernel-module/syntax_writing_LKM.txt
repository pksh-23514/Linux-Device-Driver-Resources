Parts of the Linux Kernel Module:
=================================
1. The Module can be divided into the following sections:
	1) Header sction
	2) Code section
	3) Registration section
	4) Module Description section

Header section:
===============
1. The Header section contains all the required Kernel Header files.
2. The Kernel Header files are located in the Linux cloned directory at the path (<linux_SRC>/include/linux).
3. The LKM are executed in the Kernel-space and therefore, they require the Kernel Headers which are different from the User-space Headers (C-Standard Library Headers).
4. There is no User-space library that is linked to the LKM.
5. The Kernel Headers include the C files that specify the interface between the Linux Kernel and User-space libraries and programs.
6. The Kernel Headers define the structures and constants that are needed for the building of most standard programs.
